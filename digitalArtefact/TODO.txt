TODO:

- In powerlifting, add a Goal(lift) variable for each lift as well as a current max
- When asking about their max, ask how many reps and what RPE it was to determine the next one
- @Overrwrite the getMethods function for each child class of WorkoutPlan 

- Properly store the workouts under the given name, the first parameter is the workout type and use a case statement from there
- Create a blank profile, then @overrwite a reformat function to read the file data into the correct type of workout using indiivudal setters

- THEN give functionality to each child class
