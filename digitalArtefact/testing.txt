Testing Practices for DA:

- Test blocks of code as they are being written as opposed to an exclusive large test at the end

- Log more than is necessary to give transparent feedback on where things could potentially be going wrong

- When designing larger pieces of code in a system, ensure that it is structured in a manner that it can be ran at multiple points during development without causing errors in the larger system. This makes testing easier

- In applicable cases, automate tests
